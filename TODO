stuff i know how to do:
-wayyyy better fps control
--already got the code down... just need to copy and paste some stuff into src/main.c
-fill out weapons table in src/weapons.c
--i'm using the itemtype function in cs2d lua to generate the table :D
--maybe add weapons.cfg?
-port everything from Lua Lag Compensation (which is really an entire hit detection system)

stuff i will know how to do:
-replace stuff in settings.c with sys/server.cfg
-new server options
--sv_maxmoney (default: 16000)
--sv_automoney
-HE grenades
--will need to do many measurements in cs2d to figure out how the explosion damages are calculated.
-standard gamemode
--figure out how much money is given for each won/lost round
--bomb plant/defuse
-various map entities
-rcon
-10 million "not implemented" packets the client may send

stuff i don't want to figure out:
-hostages
--cs gamemode isn't very popular anyway...
-stupid stuff
--zombies
--npcs
--all weapons you can't buy. and superarmor and that junk.
-construction
--i honestly don't see how construction servers will benefit from using a custom server.
